      <p class="sectionSubTag  text-small">Education in India is primarily provided by public
           schools (controlled and funded by the government at three levels: central, state and local) 
           and private schools. Under various articles of the Indian Constitution, free and compulsory
            education is provided as a fundamental right to children aged 6 to 14. The approximate ratio
             of public schools to private schools in India is 7:5.Unlike other countries Private Schools 
             are more common among middle class families.India has made progress in increasing the attainment
              rate of primary education. In 2011, Approximately 75% of the population, aged between 7 and 10
               years, was literate.[5] India's improved education system is often cited as one of the main
                contributors to its economic development.[6] Much of the progress, especially in higher
                 education and scientific research, has been credited to various public institutions.
                  While enrollment in higher education has increased steadily over the past decade,
                   reaching a gross enrollment ratio of 24% in 2013,[7] there still remains a significant
                    distance to catch up with tertiary education enrolment levels of developed nations,[8]
                     a challenge that will be necessary to overcome in order to continue to reap a demographic
                      dividend from India's comparatively young population.</p>

    <p class="sectionSubTag  text-small">As per the Annual Status of Education Report (ASER) 2012,
         96.5% of all rural children between the ages of 6-14 were enrolled in school. This is the
          fourth annual survey to report enrollment above 96%. India has maintained an average enrolment
           ratio of 95% for students in this age group from year 2007 to 2014. As an outcome the number of
            students in the age group 6-14 who are not enrolled in school has come down to 2.8% in the year
             academic year 2018 (ASER 2018).[11] Another report from 2013 stated that there were 229 million
              students enrolled in different accredited urban and rural schools of India, from Class I to XII,
               representing an increase of 2.3 million students over 2002 total enrolment, and a 19% increase
                in girl's enrolment.[12] While quantitatively India is inching closer to universal education,
                 the quality of its education has been questioned particularly in its government run school
                  system. While more than 95 percent of children attend primary school, just 40 percent of
                   Indian adolescents attend secondary school (Grades 9-12). </p>
